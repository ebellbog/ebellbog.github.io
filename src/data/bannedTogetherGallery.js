    description: `A story of young trans love set in a college library, against the backdrop of book banning in modern-day America. I designed this narrative-driven, first-person puzzle game with <a href="https://natmesnard.com/">Nat Mesnard</a> as part of <a href="https://www.justplayjam.com/">Just Play: A Game Jam For Justice</a>. To build <i>Banned Together</i>, we coded our <a href="https://github.com/ebellbog/bitsy-3d-plus">own custom fork</a> of the lightweight, open-source Bitsy 3D game engine. We are currently using this project for playtesting, while we develop a full-length game in Unity.`,
