    description: `A semi-cooperative, "murder mystery"-style roleplaying game, written for 10-15 players in an indoor space, with a duration of 2-3 hours.
        This sci-fi setting deals with themes of climate change, resource exploitation, long-distance space travel, and amnesia. Characters
        span a variety of roles and backgrounds, and can easily be gender-swapped within a queer-friendly narrative context. Game mechanics
        include voting procedures, individual & group "memory-recovery" activities, two computer terminals, hidden identities, and more.`,

                fostering a safe play environment &mdash; such as pronouns and consent for physical touch &mdash; these badges also encoded secret plot clues.`,
