    description: `Davis' Mega Maze is a world record-holding corn maze in western Massachusetts. For over 25 years, they've been carving designs by renowned
        maze architect <a href="https://www.mazemaker.com/">Adrian Fisher</a> into their corn field - a totally new theme each year. For five of those years,
        I developed a companion video game, perfectly matching that year's maze, which was sold as official merchandise at the farmland. These games included
        several difficulty settings, a variety of environmental options (day, night, rain), and loads of hidden, unlockable content!`,
