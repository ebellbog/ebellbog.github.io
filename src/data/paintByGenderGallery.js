    description: `This digital coloring book challenges players to paint inside the lines, while using an assortment of brushes and
        tools that don't always suit the task at hand. By presenting a tactile, visual metaphor for the narrow constraints of gender
        norms, <i>Paint by Gender</i> promotes empathy for those whose bodies, identities, and dreams don't quite fit the mold.`,
