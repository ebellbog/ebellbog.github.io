    description: `I consulted on this escape room as a lead game writer, puzzle designer, and technologist. The client
        was a successful, woman-owned business in Media, PA, with four existing rooms already in operation. Our goal was
        to offer a new kind of escape experience, blending interactive theater with game design, and eschewing traditional
        locks & keys in favor of immersive IOT technology (Kinect, Philips Hue, electric door strikes, etc). In the end,
        the client constructed a much simplified version of these high-tech designs, due to tightened budgetary constraints.`,
